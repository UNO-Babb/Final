# Final Exam

## Project Design Document
I have made a design document for a company. There are several open questions you will answer. Additionally, you should ask for clarification or make notes of things that would be useful to know in the document. Leave these as comments. Finally you will write a conclusion and justify your answer.

There is no correct answer for the conclusion, I will be looking for how you justified your answer based on what we have discussed this semester.

Make a copy of this google doc and submit a shared link with your copied document.
**Make sure that you have set the permissions so that anyone with a link can view your document before you submit.**

## Programming Problem
Use the examples we have looked at with Pandas and Matplotlib to make a graph of the **billionares.csv** dataset. The graph that you make should look at the year their company is founded.

There are a few missing pieces of data where the founding year is listed as zero. Your program should exclude these entries... don't modify the data file, your code should remove the bad data from our list.

Some billionaires are listed multiple times, we won't worry about excluding duplicates for this project.

Please save your code and your graph to your Repl.it project.
